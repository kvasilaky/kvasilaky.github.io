						My research is in experimental and development economics, as well as the intersection of data science and econometrics.  In my applied work I focus on the economic development via group-based technology adoption, and gender and competition. In my methodological work I focus on bias correction methods - where the bias may be statisical, user-driven, or algorithmic.
